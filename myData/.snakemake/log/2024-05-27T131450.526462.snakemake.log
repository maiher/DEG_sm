MissingOutputException in rule fastqc in file /data/home/AD/hermi/sm_tutorial/BYOC/myData/workflow/Snakefile.smk, line 37:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
0246_2_TP04_026_FC_MOD_1TR1_SL1_S26_L002_R1_001_50k_fastq.fastp.gz (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
